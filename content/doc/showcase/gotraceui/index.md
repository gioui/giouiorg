Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces. It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and more powerful alternative to go tool trace. Unlike go tool trace, Gotraceui doesn’t use deprecated browser APIs (or a browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.
